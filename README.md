# Cake App üéÇ

Welcome to the **Cake App**, a delightful web application built with **Nuxt.js**! This app is designed to showcase a variety of cakes, provide recipes, and allow users to add comments and rate the cakes.

The app is a simple CRUD application which perfoms the following requests :
‚óè GET /cakes   - shows list of all the cakes (name and image) on the Home button
‚óè GET /cakes/{id} - clicking on the image takes you to a single cake image, with comments, yum factor and other data being displayed
‚óè POST /cakes - Submit a cake button allows you to add a new cake using a form. The url is any url from the internet of a jpeg or png file. 
‚óè PUT /cakes/{id}  - use the Update button to update existing cake data. 
‚óè DELETE /cakes/{id} - use the delete button on Home page to delete any cake. 

The data is written and read from a file as you submit, update or delete a cake.
